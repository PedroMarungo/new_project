# New Git Project
## Learning Mark Down
+ Created in 2004 by John Gruder
+ Converts into a small subset of HTML tags
+ Does not need a file extension to be use but platforms like **GitHub** require it

  Learning markdown syntax is great for documentation purposes
### Useful for README on GitHub
#### Created to be easy to read and write
